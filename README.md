**SAID - Quick Audio Recording** is a free and easy to use audio recorder for Android specifically designed for high-quality and long-time recording with a clean and simple User Interface.

This audio recorder provides high-quality recordings without any time limit - limited only by memory size (quite obvious why).
You can use it for recording voice notes and memos, business meetings, interviews, lectures, speeches, concerts, sleep talking :) or anything else.

The app records and saves the recordings in the internal memory of the device which are easily accessible in the app itself. Although, if you want to access the recordings in the internal memory, you can go to *Internal Storage -> Android -> data -> com.developerdepository.said -> files -> audio* and BINGO!
